Data science portfolio

# [Project 1 : Time Series Analysis](https://github.com/khns26/mini_project/blob/90b98cbf188f9724876d4e5c2ede3dac06de1cfd/Time%20Series%20Forecasting.R)
- Time Series is a series of data that are assembled over even intervals in time and ordered chronologically
- In this project, i analyzed monthly stocks price in 5 years using Box-Jenkins iteration model
- I predicted one month ahead stocks price using ARIMA(0,1,1) model

# [Project 2 : Modeling CO2 Emission and Engine Size Using Linear Regression](https://github.com/khns26/mini_project/blob/90b98cbf188f9724876d4e5c2ede3dac06de1cfd/Modeling_CO2_Emission_and_Engine_Size.ipynb)
- I analyzed data of fuel consumption of vehicles
- And then i scatterplotted the data of CO2 Emission and Engine Size to know the relationship
- It told us that the larger engine size, the higher its CO2 Emisson
- Then i modeled the data using Linear Regression and plotted with train data

# [Project 3 : Modeling and Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression](https://github.com/khns26/mini_project/blob/d66e6626afd4e3788a2f4ede62d67a879a9c4dfc/LinearRegression-House%20Price%20Modeling.ipynb)
- I made a model to predict house prices using array of numbers
- This only uses 1 feature which is number of bedrooms
